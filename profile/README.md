## Hi there 👋, Welcome To Kawan-Usaha-API
Kawan Usaha is a collaborative project undertaken by our team with the goal of developing an application that assists individuals, particularly SMEs, in their business growth journey by providing them with a personalized virtual mentor. Kawan-Usaha-Api, an API specifically designed for this purpose, serves as a data storage solution for managing various user account database, including login credentials, registration details, password recovery, email verification, and profile editing. Additionally, it enables the integration of Language and Learning Models (LLMs) to facilitate the presence of a virtual mentor within our app. Furthermore, the API includes functionality to manage articles, allowing users to share their experiences with other users.
